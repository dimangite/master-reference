## Research topics

### Types of testing
- What is a unit test?
- What is an integration test?
- What is end-to-end testing?
- When would you use each kind of test?

### Testing Frameworks
- What are some commonly used test frameworks?
- What features are similar between different test frameworks?
- What differences can you find?
- Challenge! Write and demo some tests in a testing framework other than Tape.

### DOM manipulation
- How can you use JavaScript to create an HTML element and then add it to your webpage? How would you replace an existing element with it?
- How would you add a `<li>` element to the start of a `<ul>`?

- What is a NodeList? How is it different from an Array?
- What are the security concerns around `Element.innerHTML` and what could you use instead?
- Challenge! Create a web page with an empty `<body>` and add some content using JavaScript

### Test coverage
- What is test coverage?
- Why is test coverage useful?
- What are Istanbul and nyc?
- How would you use them to improve your testing?
- Challenge! Use Istanbul/nyc to calculate your code coverage for the TDD workshop.
